# Stochastic-Processes
Here are assignments I have done during my Stochastic Processes course, 2017 Fall.
The course instructor was professor Wen-Chih Chen, Ph.D. from NCTU IEM. The course was taught in English.

Throughout the course, professor showed patience and wisdom guiding us on the way of learning some common topics, and it is by far one of the most enjoyable learning experiences I've ever had.

In each of the assignment files are questions and answers. Most of it are mathematics, only some arithmetic are done using R.
