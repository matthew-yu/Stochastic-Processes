# Stochastic-Processes
Here are assignments I have done during my Stochastic Processes course, 2017 Fall.
I have PDF files for viewers, and R Markdown files (.RMD) since I used plenty of LaTeX-like expressions for the assignments.
The course instructor was professor Wen-Chih Chen, Ph.D. from NCTU IEM. The course was taught in English.

The textbook used was: Introduction to Probability Models, by Sheldon Ross, 11th ed., Academic Press.

Throughout the course, professor showed patience and wisdom guiding us on the way of learning some common topics, and it is by far one of the most enjoyable learning experiences I've ever had. By the end of the semester, we have covered Chapter 1 to 6.

In each of the assignment files are questions and answers. Most of it are mathematics, only some arithmetic caculations are done by using R.
